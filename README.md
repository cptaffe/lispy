lispy
=====

lisp-like language interpreter written in python

## How to

If you want to run stuff do:
```sh
./lispy
```
Note: this uses pypy, so if you don't have pypy, you can either edit the shebang or do:
```sh
python lispy
```
You can route files through stdin or whatever.

## Test with input.lsp

To test the compiler using input.lsp or whatevs, do:
```sh
./lispy < input.lsp
```
